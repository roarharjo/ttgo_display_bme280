This directory is intended for PlatformIO Test Runner and project tests.

Unit Testing is a software testing method by which individual units of
source code, sets of one or more MCU program modules together with associated
control data, usage procedures, and operating procedures, are tested to
determine whether they are fit for use. Unit testing finds problems early
in the development cycle.

For this project, potential test cases include:
- BME280 sensor initialization and reading verification
- TFT display initialization and drawing functions
- I2C communication testing
- Temperature and humidity measurement accuracy validation

Example test structure:
/test
  /test_bme280
    test_sensor_init.cpp
    test_measurements.cpp
  /test_display
    test_tft_init.cpp
    test_drawing.cpp

Note: When testing hardware-dependent functionality, appropriate test mocks
may be required for the BME280 sensor and TFT display components.
